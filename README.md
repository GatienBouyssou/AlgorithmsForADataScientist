# Algorithm Comparison 

In this repository you will find experiments and reports comparing/explaining methods and algorithms that are often used in Data Science. The idea was to compare  different algorithms on multiple datasets to find out where they were performing better. That way, it is possible to understand under which conditions we should use our algorithms.
